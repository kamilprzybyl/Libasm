<!--I actually have no clue why I did it..., I guess just out of boredom...<br />-->
Some assembly basics to get to know the syntax of x86 assembly and broaden my knowledge into Kernel.

## Foreword
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architectureâ€™s machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

## In a nutshell
The project contains basic functions implemented in Assembly.
