# Libasm
The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.

# The language
An assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for a specific type of processor.
<br />It describes the succession of commands your processor will execute. One line means one instruction. 
</br >Most programs consist of **directives** followed by one or more **sections**. Lines can have an optional **label**. Most lines have an **instruction** followed by zero or more **operands**.<br />The assembly language is a language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

  - `ft_strcpy`
  - `ft_strcmp`
  - `ft_write`
  - `ft_read`
  - `ft_strdup`
  -  *and more...*
